## Key Setup

ArgoCD Interlace uses 3 key files inside `keys` directory.

All the 3 keys will be automatically prepared by `gpg` / `cosign` commands if any of them does not exist.

You can setup these keys when you want to use the existing key files.

- `pubring.gpg` - GPG verification key for source repo contents
  - (if not exist) auto-imported from gpg command
- `cosign.key` - Cosign signing key for resource manifests
  - (if not exist) auto-generated by cosign command
- `cosign.pub` - Cosign verification key included in provenance record
  - (if not exist) auto-generated by cosign command
